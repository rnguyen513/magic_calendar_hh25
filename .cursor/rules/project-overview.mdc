## **Project Overview**
We are building an **AI-powered academic productivity assistant** designed to help students manage their coursework efficiently. The core functionality includes:

1. **To-Do List & Calendar Automation**  
   - AI organizes assignments, exams, and deadlines by pulling structured data from learning management systems (LMS) like Canvas.  
   - Tasks are prioritized based on due dates, weight on final grades, and estimated effort.

2. **Notes Management & AI Summarization**  
   - Users can upload **PDFs, text, and audio files**, which the AI processes to generate structured, concise summaries.  
   - Summaries follow a consistent format for quick review.  
   - Future feature: interactive quizzes generated from notes.

3. **AI-Powered Task Prioritization**  
   - Uses **sentiment analysis** and assignment metadata (e.g., grading weight, due dates) to rank tasks dynamically.  
   - Ensures students focus on the highest-impact work first.
