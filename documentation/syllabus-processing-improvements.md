# Syllabus Processing Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've improved the syllabus upload and processing functionality by:

1. Changing the button text from "Go to Schedule Page" to "Syllabus" for better user clarity
2. Enhancing the PDF processing in the syllabus upload API to leverage the same approach used in the Study Materials section for quizzes and summaries

## Technical Improvements

### Button Text Update
- Modified the navigation button text in `app/(chat)/page.tsx` to be more descriptive and intuitive

### Syllabus Processing Enhancements
- Replaced the custom PDF extraction and processing approach with the more robust streamObject method from the Vercel AI SDK
- Added proper schema validation using Zod, ensuring consistent data structure
- Directly passed the PDF data to Gemini AI for processing, eliminating the intermediate text extraction step
- Improved error handling and added fallback mechanisms
- Ensured type safety throughout the processing pipeline

## Implementation Details

The new processing approach:

1. Defines a strict schema for syllabus events using Zod
2. Sends the PDF directly to Gemini AI with appropriate prompts
3. Processes the AI response in the onFinish callback
4. Converts the extracted events to calendar-compatible format
5. Returns both events and course information to the client

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: By using the advanced AI capabilities directly with the PDF, we get better extraction results
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Proper schema validation ensures consistent data structure
- **Streamlined Processing**: Eliminated unnecessary steps in the processing pipeline
- **Consistent UX**: Now uses the same approach as other PDF processing features in the app

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the future:

- Add ability to save processed syllabi for future reference
- Implement batch processing for multiple syllabi
- Add more detailed event categorization and prioritization
- Enhance the UI for syllabus upload with progress indicators and preview capabilities
