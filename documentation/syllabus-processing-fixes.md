# Syllabus Processing Fixes

## Issue Description

The syllabus upload functionality was experiencing a critical error where:
1. The upload would start and the progress bar would move to approximately 30%
2. The process would then stall and eventually fail with an error "Failed to process syllabus"
3. Users were unable to complete the syllabus upload process

## Root Causes Identified

After investigation, we identified several issues:

1. **Timeout Issues**: The API route for processing syllabi used a default timeout of 60 seconds, which was insufficient for processing larger or more complex PDF files.

2. **Asynchronous Handling Problems**: The implementation didn't properly wait for the streamObject process to complete before returning a response.

3. **Error Handling Issues**: Error handling was inadequate, providing generic error messages and not properly handling specific error cases.

4. **Progress Feedback**: The progress bar moved too quickly, giving users a false expectation of processing speed.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. API Route Improvements (`app/api/syllabus/process/route.ts`)

- Increased the maxDuration from 60 to 300 seconds (5 minutes) to allow for longer processing times
- Improved the Promise handling by creating a proper Promise wrapper around the streamObject call
- Added a 4-minute timeout with proper cleanup to prevent hanging requests
- Added extensive logging to better track the processing flow
- Fixed the event type handling to ensure proper typing in the response
- Enhanced error handling with more specific error messages

### 2. Modal Component Improvements (`components/schedule/_modals/syllabus-upload-modal.tsx`)

- Slowed down the progress bar animation to better reflect actual processing time
- Added a retry mechanism to automatically attempt a second processing if the first fails
- Implemented request timeouts with AbortController to prevent indefinite hanging
- Added more informative toast messages specific to different error types
- Improved error recovery by properly resetting state
- Enhanced the user experience with better feedback on processing status

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Reliability**: The syllabus processing now handles larger and more complex documents
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better feedback through appropriate progress indication and informative error messages
3. **Automatic Recovery**: The retry mechanism helps users recover from temporary failures
4. **Server Protection**: Proper timeouts prevent server resource exhaustion
5. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging makes troubleshooting easier

## Future Considerations

1. Implement file size and complexity validation before sending to the API
2. Add a more granular progress tracking system based on actual processing stages
3. Consider implementing a queuing system for processing large files during peak usage
4. Add metrics tracking to monitor processing times and success rates
