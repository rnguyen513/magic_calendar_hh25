# Syllabus Upload Processing Fix

## Issue Description

The syllabus upload functionality was experiencing issues where:
1. The upload process would start but get stuck at 85% and never complete
2. The processing time was excessively long compared to similar PDF processing in the Study Materials section
3. The processing would sometimes time out without providing any feedback to the user

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we found that the syllabus processing implementation was fundamentally different from the approach used in the Quiz and Summary generators in the Study Materials section:

1. **Improper Stream Handling**: The syllabus processing API wasn't utilizing the streaming capabilities of the AI SDK properly.
   - It was attempting to process the complete response at once rather than streaming it
   - It used a custom Promise-based wrapping approach that didn't match the SDK's design

2. **Client-Side Implementation**: The modal component wasn't using the specialized AI hooks that are designed to work with streaming responses.
   - It attempted to manage streaming and progress manually instead of letting the framework handle it

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Route Improvements (`app/api/syllabus/process/route.ts`)

- Refactored the API route to follow the same pattern as the quizzes and summary endpoints
- Removed the custom Promise wrapping and timeout handling
- Changed the response to properly return the streaming result directly
- Simplified error handling to match the patterns used elsewhere

### 2. Modal Component Improvements (`components/schedule/_modals/syllabus-upload-modal.tsx`)

- Implemented the `experimental_useObject` hook from `ai/react` to handle streaming properly
- Updated the progress indicator to reflect real progress based on received data
- Improved the user experience with better feedback during processing
- Moved the object processing logic to the client side to match the approach in other components

## Advantages of the New Approach

1. **Consistent Implementation**: Now uses the same approach as the rest of the application
2. **Real-Time Progress**: Shows actual progress based on the data being received
3. **Better Error Handling**: Integrates with the AI SDK's error handling
4. **Improved Performance**: Properly utilizes the streaming capabilities of the SDK
5. **Code Reusability**: Follows the established patterns in the codebase

## Testing Results

The updated implementation successfully processes syllabus PDFs of various sizes, with significantly improved reliability and user experience:
- Processing starts immediately
- Progress indicator shows real incremental progress
- Processing completes successfully with events being added to the calendar
- Error handling works properly for various error conditions

## Future Considerations

1. Further improve error reporting for specific types of PDF parsing failures
2. Consider adding a preview of detected events before adding them to the calendar
3. Implement caching of processed syllabi to improve performance for repeated uploads
